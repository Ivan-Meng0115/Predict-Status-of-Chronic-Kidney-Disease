# Predict-Status-of-Chronic-Kidney-Disease
In this project I will show you how to create predictive machine learning model using python program to predict and classify patience as having chronic kidney disease (ckd) or not.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the 16th leading cause of years of life lost worldwide. Appropriate screening, diagnosis, and management by primary care clinicians are necessary to prevent adverse CKD-associated outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, end-stage kidney disease, and death. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects between 8% and 16% of the population worldwide and is often underrecognized by patients and clinicians.
